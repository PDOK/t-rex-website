Installation
------------

Pre-built binaries are available for 64 bit Linux and Windows. Download your binary from [github.com/pka/t-rex/releases](https://github.com/pka/t-rex/releases) and unpack it.

`t_rex` is an executable with very few dependencies, essentially `libgcc_s.so.1` on Linux and `msvcr120.dll` on Windows. If `msvcr120.dll` is missing, install `vcredist_x64.exe` from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40784).
